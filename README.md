# Tic-Tac-Toe AI Game
Tic-Tac-Toe is a classic two-player game now enhanced with an AI opponent! This Python implementation allows you to play against the computer, which uses artificial intelligence to make its moves. The goal remains the same: get three of your marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) before your opponent does.

# Features
- GUI based: 
- Single-Player Mode: Play against a computer opponent.
- AI Opponent: The computer uses AI to make optimal moves.
- User-Friendly Interface: Simple text-based gameplay.
- Input Validation: Ensures valid player moves.
- Win/Draw Detection: Automatically detects the outcome of the game.

# How To Play
1- The game is played on a 3x3 grid.
2- You play as X, and the computer plays as O.
3- Players alternate turns, placing their mark in an empty cell.
4- The first to get three marks in a row (horizontal, vertical, or diagonal) wins.
5- If all cells are filled and no one has three in a row, the game ends in a draw.

# How to Run
RUN python tic_tac_toe.py

# How the AI Works
The AI opponent uses algorithms like Minimax to analyze the game board and make optimal moves. This makes the AI a challenging opponent that tries to block your winning moves and set up its own
